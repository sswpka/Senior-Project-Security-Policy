Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Vulnerability - If you discover a security vulnerability, we would be very grateful if you could email us at gradio-team@huggingface.co. This is the preferred approach instead of opening a public issue. We take all vulnerability reports seriously, and will work to patch the vulnerability immediately. Whenever possible, we will credit the person or people who report the security vulnerabilities after it has been patched."
Reporting mechanism,"Vulnerability Disclosure - If you think you have found a potential security vulnerability in
requests, please email [Nate](mailto:nate.prewitt@gmail.com)
and [Seth](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com) directly.
**Do not file a public issue.**

Our PGP Key fingerprints are:

- 8722 7E29 AD9C FF5C FAC3  EA6A 44D3 FF97 B80D C864 ([@nateprewitt](https://keybase.io/nateprewitt))

You can also contact us on [Keybase](https://keybase.io) with the
profiles above if desired.

If English is not your first language, please try to describe the
problem and its impact to the best of your ability. For greater detail,
please use your native language and we will try our best to translate it
using online services.

Please also include the code you used to find the problem and the
shortest amount of code necessary to reproduce it.

Please do not disclose this to anyone else. We will retrieve a CVE
identifier if necessary and give you full credit under whatever name or
alias you provide. We will only request an identifier when we have a fix
and can publish it in a release.

We will respect your privacy and will only publicize your involvement if
you grant us permission."
User guideline,"Process - This following information discusses the process the requests project
follows in response to vulnerability disclosures. If you are disclosing
a vulnerability, this section of the documentation lets you know how we
will respond to your disclosure."
Projects practise,"Timeline - When you report an issue, one of the project members will respond to you
within two days *at the outside*. In most cases responses will be
faster, usually within 12 hours. This initial response will at the very
least confirm receipt of the report.

If we were able to rapidly reproduce the issue, the initial response
will also contain confirmation of the issue. If we are not, we will
often ask for more information about the reproduction scenario.

Our goal is to have a fix for any vulnerability released within two
weeks of the initial disclosure. This may potentially involve shipping
an interim release that simply disables function while a more mature fix
can be prepared, but will in the vast majority of cases mean shipping a
complete release as soon as possible.

Throughout the fix process we will keep you up to speed with how the fix
is progressing. Once the fix is prepared, we will notify you that we
believe we have a fix. Often we will ask you to confirm the fix resolves
the problem in your environment, especially if we are not confident of
our reproduction scenario.

At this point, we will prepare for the release. We will obtain a CVE
number if one is required, providing you with full credit for the
discovery. We will also decide on a planned release date, and let you
know when it is. This release date will *always* be on a weekday.

At this point we will reach out to our major downstream packagers to
notify them of an impending security-related patch so they can make
arrangements. In addition, these packagers will be provided with the
intended patch ahead of time, to ensure that they are able to promptly
release their downstream packages. Currently the list of people we
actively contact *ahead of a public release* is:

-   Jeremy Cline, Red Hat (@jeremycline)
-   Daniele Tricoli, Debian (@eriol)

We will notify these individuals at least a week ahead of our planned
release date to ensure that they have sufficient time to prepare. If you
believe you should be on this list, please let one of the maintainers
know at one of the email addresses at the top of this article.

On release day, we will push the patch to our public repository, along
with an updated changelog that describes the issue and credits you. We
will then issue a PyPI release containing the patch.

At this point, we will publicise the release. This will involve mails to
mailing lists, Tweets, and all other communication mechanisms available
to the core team.

We will also explicitly mention which commits contain the fix to make it
easier for other distributors and users to easily patch their own
versions of requests if upgrading is not an option."

for responsible disclosure and prompt mitigation. We are committed to working with security researchers to
resolve the vulnerabilities they discover."
Scope of practise,"Supported Versions - The latest version of MLflow has continued support. If a critical vulnerability is found in the current version
of MLflow, we may opt to backport patches to previous versions."
Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Vulnerability - When finding a security vulnerability in MLflow, please perform the following actions:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report_template.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%20Security%20Vulnerability) on the MLflow repository. Ensure that you use `[BUG] Security Vulnerability` as the title and _do not_ mention any vulnerability details in the issue post.
- Send a notification [email](mailto:mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com) to `mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com` that contains, at a minimum:
  - The link to the filed issue stub.
  - Your GitHub handle.
  - Detailed information about the security vulnerability, evidence that supports the relevance of the finding and any reproducibility instructions for independent confirmation.

This first stage of reporting is to ensure that a rapid validation can occur without wasting the time and effort of a reporter. Future communication and vulnerability resolution will be conducted after validating
the veracity of the reported issue.

An MLflow maintainer will, after validating the report:

- Acknowledge the [bug](ISSUE_POLICY.md#bug-reports) during [triage](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst)
- Mark the issue as `priority/critical-urgent`
- Open a draft [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory)
  to discuss the vulnerability details in private.

The private Security Advisory will be used to confirm the issue, prepare a fix, and publicly disclose it after the fix has been released."
Reporting mechanism,"How to report a security issue - To report a (suspected) security issue, please email `bugbounty@prefect.io` and follow the instructions for our [bug bounty program](https://www.prefect.io/bug-bounty).

Prefect will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within 48 hours. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance."

User guideline,Security Announcements - Join the #nautobot channel in the Network to Code Slack for messages about security and release announcements.
Reporting mechanism,"Report a Vulnerability - We appreciate the time security researchers and users contribute to reporting vulnerabilities to the Nautobot Community.

If you feel your report is safe for public disclosure (a CVE related to a dependency, or a low-risk bug) please feel free to open a bug [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/new/choose).

If you are unsure of the severity of your report or you feel it should not be publicly disclosed until a fix has been released, you can also email [security@nautobot.com](mailto:security@nautobot.com) with the security details.

You may encrypt your email with the GPG keys of the security response members below. While accepted, encryption using GPG is NOT mandatory to make a disclosure."
User guideline,"When Should I Report a Vulnerability? - - You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Nautobot
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Nautobot
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Nautobot depends on"
User guideline,"When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability? - - You need help configuring Nautobot security settings (such as external auth)
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related"
Projects practise,"Security Vulnerability Response - Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by security response members within five (5) working days.

Any vulnerability information shared with security response members stays within the Nautobot project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated."
Projects practise,"Public Disclosure Timing - A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Nautobot maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of ten (10) days. The Nautobot maintainers hold the final say when setting a disclosure date.

Disclosures, regardless of outcome, [will be published on GitHub](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues?q=label%3A%22security+disclosure%22) with the label ""security disclosure""."

The SaltStack Security Team is available at saltproject-security.pdl@broadcom.com for
security-related bug reports or questions.

We request the disclosure of any security-related bugs or issues be reported
non-publicly until such time as the issue can be resolved and a security-fix
release can be prepared. At that time we will release the fix and make a public
announcement with upgrade instructions and download locations."
Reporting mechanism,"Security response procedure - SaltStack takes security and the trust of our customers and users very
seriously. Our disclosure policy is intended to resolve security issues as
quickly and safely as is possible.

1.  A security report sent to saltproject-security.pdl@broadcom.com is assigned to a team
    member. This person is the primary contact for questions and will
    coordinate the fix, release, and announcement.

2.  The reported issue is reproduced and confirmed. A list of affected projects
    and releases is made.

3.  Fixes are implemented for all affected projects and releases that are
    actively supported. Back-ports of the fix are made to any old releases that
    are actively supported.

4.  Packagers are notified via the [salt-packagers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/salt-packagers) mailing list that an issue
    was reported and resolved, and that an announcement is incoming.

5.  A new release is created and pushed to all affected repositories. The
    release documentation provides a full description of the issue, plus any
    upgrade instructions or other relevant details.

6.  An announcement is made to the [salt-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/salt-users) and [salt-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/salt-announce) mailing
    lists. The announcement contains a description of the issue and a link to
    the full release documentation and download locations."

User guideline,"Before Reporting - There are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be
found at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please
review the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of
caution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to
report a regular issue instead."
Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Security Issue - If you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or
Pallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a
security issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the
project's repository, click ""Security"" at the top, then click ""Advisories"" at
the left, then click the green ""New draft security advisory"" button.
Alternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),
and we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting
normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address

  - as of May 2024, the [`0.4.0`](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/releases/tag/v0.4.0) release is the most comprehensively reviewed one and is recommended for use in production environments
- if a compiler vulnerability is found, a new compiler version with a patch will be released. The vulnerable version itself is not updated (see the examples below).

User guideline,"Scope - - Rules from the Ethereum Foundation's bug bounty program apply; for any questions please reach out [here](mailto:bounty@ethereum.org). Here we further clarify the scope of the Vyper bounty program.
- If a compiler bug affects production code, it is in scope (excluding known issues).
  - This includes bugs in older compiler versions still used in production.
- If a compiler bug does not currently affect production but is likely to in the future, it is in scope.
  - This mainly applies to the latest compiler release (e.g., a new release is available but contracts are not yet deployed with it).
  - Experimental features (e.g. `--experimental-codegen`) are out of scope, as they are not intended for production and are unlikely to affect production code.
  - Bugs in older compiler versions are generally out of scope, as they are no longer used for new contracts.
    - There might be exceptions, e.g., when an L2 doesn't support recent compiler releases. In such cases, it might be reasonable for an older version to be used. It is up to the discretion of the EF & Vyper team to decide if the bug is in scope.
- If a vulnerability affects multiple contracts, the whitehat is eligible for only one payout (though the severity of the bug may increase).
- Eligibility for project-specific bounties is independent of this bounty.
- [Security advisories](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories) and [known issues](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues) are not eligible for the bounty program, as they are publicly disclosed and protocols should structure their contracts accordingly.

Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a vulnerability - Even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable
vulnerability, it is recommended to send the report and not to
discuss the issue anywhere else.

Vulnerabilities are expected to be discussed _only_ via email,
and not in public, until an official release to address the
vulnerability is available.

Examples for details to include:

- Ideally a short description (or a script) to demonstrate an
  exploit.
- The affected platforms and scenarios.
- The name and affiliation of the security researchers who are
  involved in the discovery, if any.
- Whether the vulnerability has already been disclosed.
- How long an embargo would be required to be safe."
Scope of practise,"Supported Versions - There are no official ""Long Term Support"" versions in jsonpickle.
Instead, the maintenance track (i.e. the versions based on the
most recently published feature release, also known as "".0""
version) sees occasional updates with bug fixes.

Fixes to vulnerabilities are made for the maintenance track for
the latest feature release. The jsonpickle project makes no formal
guarantee for any older maintenance tracks to receive updates.
In practice, though, critical vulnerability fixes can be applied not
only to the most recent track, but to at least a couple more
maintenance tracks if requested by users."
User guideline,"Security - The jsonpickle module **is not secure**.  Only unpickle data you trust.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will **execute
arbitrary code during unpickling**.  Never unpickle data that could have come
from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.

Consider signing data with an HMAC if you need to ensure that it has not
been tampered with.

Safer deserialization approaches, such as reading JSON directly,
may be more appropriate if you are processing untrusted data."

Generic policy,"Using TensorFlow Securely - This document discusses the TensorFlow security model. It describes the security
risks to consider when using models, checkpoints or input data for training or
serving. We also provide guidelines on what constitutes a vulnerability in
TensorFlow and how to report them.

This document applies to other repositories in the TensorFlow organization,
covering security practices for the entirety of the TensorFlow ecosystem."
User guideline,"TensorFlow models are programs - TensorFlow
[**models**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#model) (to
use a term commonly used by machine learning practitioners) are expressed as
programs that TensorFlow executes. TensorFlow programs are encoded as
computation
[**graphs**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#graph).
Since models are practically programs that TensorFlow executes, using untrusted
models or graphs is equivalent to running untrusted code.

If you need to run untrusted models, execute them inside a
[**sandbox**](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing). Memory corruptions
in TensorFlow ops can be recognized as security issues only if they are
reachable and exploitable through production-grade, benign models."
User guideline,"Compilation - Compiling models via the recommended entry points described in
[XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) and
[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html)
documentation should be safe, while some of the testing and debugging tools that
come with the compiler are not designed to be used with untrusted data and
should be used with caution when working with untrusted models."
User guideline,"Saved graphs and checkpoints - When loading untrusted serialized computation graphs (in form of a `GraphDef`,
`SavedModel`, or equivalent on-disk format), the set of computation primitives
available to TensorFlow is powerful enough that you should assume that the
TensorFlow process effectively executes arbitrary code.

The risk of loading untrusted checkpoints depends on the code or graph that you
are working with. When loading untrusted checkpoints, the values of the traced
variables from your model are also going to be untrusted. That means that if
your code interacts with the filesystem, network, etc. and uses checkpointed
variables as part of those interactions (ex: using a string variable to build a
filesystem path), a maliciously created checkpoint might be able to change the
targets of those operations, which could result in arbitrary
read/write/executions."
User guideline,"Running a TensorFlow server - TensorFlow is a platform for distributed computing, and as such there is a
TensorFlow server (`tf.train.Server`). The TensorFlow server is intended for
internal communication only. It is not built for use in untrusted environments
or networks.

For performance reasons, the default TensorFlow server does not include any
authorization protocol and sends messages unencrypted. It accepts connections
from anywhere, and executes the graphs it is sent without performing any checks.
Therefore, if you run a `tf.train.Server` in your network, anybody with access
to the network can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the `tf.train.Server`."
User guideline,"Untrusted inputs during training and prediction - TensorFlow supports a wide range of input data formats. For example it can
process images, audio, videos, and text. There are several modules specialized
in taking those formats, modifying them, and/or converting them to intermediate
formats that can be processed by TensorFlow.

These modifications and conversions are handled by a variety of libraries that
have different security properties and provide different levels of confidence
when dealing with untrusted data. Based on the security history of these
libraries we consider that it is safe to work with untrusted inputs for PNG,
BMP, GIF, WAV, RAW, RAW\_PADDED, CSV and PROTO formats. All other input formats,
including tensorflow-io should be sandboxed if used to process untrusted data.

For example, if an attacker were to upload a malicious video file, they could
potentially exploit a vulnerability in the TensorFlow code that handles videos,
which could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the system running
TensorFlow.

It is important to keep TensorFlow up to date with the latest security patches
and follow the sandboxing guideline above to protect against these types of
vulnerabilities."
User guideline,"Security properties of execution modes - TensorFlow has several execution modes, with Eager-mode being the default in v2.
Eager mode lets users write imperative-style statements that can be easily
inspected and debugged and it is intended to be used during the development
phase.

As part of the differences that make Eager mode easier to debug, the [shape
inference
functions](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/create_op#define_the_op_interface)
are skipped, and any checks implemented inside the shape inference code are not
executed.

The security impact of skipping those checks should be low, since the attack
scenario would require a malicious user to be able to control the model which as
stated above is already equivalent to code execution. In any case, the
recommendation is not to serve models using Eager mode since it also has
performance limitations."
User guideline,"Multi-Tenant environments - It is possible to run multiple TensorFlow models in parallel. For example,
`ModelServer` collates all computation graphs exposed to it (from multiple
`SavedModel`) and executes them in parallel on available executors. Running
TensorFlow in a multitenant design mixes the risks described above with the
inherent ones from multitenant configurations. The primary areas of concern are
tenant isolation, resource allocation, model sharing and hardware attacks."
User guideline,"Tenant isolation - Since any tenants or users providing models, graphs or checkpoints can execute
code in context of the TensorFlow service, it is important to design isolation
mechanisms that prevent unwanted access to the data from other tenants.

Network isolation between different models is also important not only to prevent
unauthorized access to data or models, but also to prevent malicious users or
tenants sending graphs to execute under another tenant’s identity.

The isolation mechanisms are the responsibility of the users to design and
implement, and therefore security issues deriving from their absence are not
considered a vulnerability in TensorFlow."
User guideline,"Resource allocation - A denial of service caused by one model could bring down the entire server, but
we don't consider this as a vulnerability, given that models can exhaust
resources in many different ways and solutions exist to prevent this from
happening (e.g., rate limits, ACLs, monitors to restart broken servers)."
User guideline,"Model sharing - If the multitenant design allows sharing models, make sure that tenants and
users are aware of the security risks detailed here and that they are going to
be practically running code provided by other users. Currently there are no good
ways to detect malicious models/graphs/checkpoints, so the recommended way to
mitigate the risk in this scenario is to sandbox the model execution."
User guideline,"Hardware attacks - Physical GPUs or TPUs can also be the target of attacks. [Published
research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gpu+side+channel) shows that it
might be possible to use side channel attacks on the GPU to leak data from other
running models or processes in the same system. GPUs can also have
implementation bugs that might allow attackers to leave malicious code running
and leak or tamper with applications from other users. Please report
vulnerabilities to the vendor of the affected hardware accelerator."

Generic policy,Using PaddlePaddle Securely - This document describes model security and code security in PaddlePaddle. It also provides guidelines on how to report vulnerabilities in PaddlePaddle.
User guideline,"PaddlePaddle Model Security - PaddlePaddle attaches great importance to security and privacy of model. This includes how to prevent the model from outputting wrong decision results under the interference when it is used in security-related and safety-critical scenarios, and how to avoid leaking data and privacy information from the model itself, the model gradient or the model inference results.



[PaddleSleeve](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSleeve) provides a series of security and privacy tools, which can help model developers and users systematically evaluate and improve the model security and privacy in both development and deployment stages.



These tools include adversarial example evaluation test, pseudo-natural environment robustness evaluation test, model reversing evaluation test, member inference evaluation test, sample denoising, adversarial training, privacy enhancement optimizer, etc."
User guideline,"Running untrusted models - Always load and execute untrusted models inside a sandbox and be sure to know the security impacts.
There are several ways in which a model could become untrusted. PaddlePaddle has enough features to impact on the system. (e.g. `paddle.load` uses [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) implicitly, which may cause malformed models to achieve arbitrary code execution). So we recommend when using the untrusted models, you need to carefully audit it and run PaddlePaddle inside a sandbox."
User guideline,"PaddlePaddle Code Security - PaddlePaddle always take code security seriously. However, due to the complexity of the framework and its dependence on other thirdparty open source libraries, there may still be some security issues undetected. Therefore, we hope that more security researchers and PaddlePaddle developers can participate in the code security program. We encourage responsible disclosure of security issues, as well as contributing code to improve our vulnerability finding tools to make PaddlePaddle safer."
User guideline,"Code security tools - PaddlePaddle security team attaches great importance to the security of the framework. In order to find and fix security issues as soon as possible, we are continuously conducting code security audit and developing automatic vunerability discovery tools. We have already open sourced some of them to the community, hoping this could encourage people to contribute and improve the safety and robustness of PaddlePaddle. [This tool](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSleeve/tree/main/CodeSecurity) includes two parts. The dynamic part includes some op fuzzer samples. And the static part includes some CodeQL samples. Both of them are aim to find vulnerabilities in PaddlePaddle framework codebase. By referring the samples, security researchers can write their own fuzzers or QLs to test more PaddlePaddle modules, and find more code security issues."
Reporting mechanism,"Reporting vulnerabilities - We encourage responsible disclosure of security issues to PaddlePaddle and please email reports about any security issues you find to paddle-security@baidu.com.



After the security team receives your email, they will communicate with you in time. The security team will work to keep you informed of an issue fix.



In order to reproduce and identify the issue, please include the following information along with your email:

- The details of the vulnerability including how to reproduce it. Try to attach a PoC.
- The attack scenario and what an attacker might be able to achieve with this issue.
- Whether this vulnerability has been made public. If it is, please attach details.
- Your name and affiliation.

We will indicate the bug fix in the release of PaddlePaddle, and publish the vulnerability detail and the reporter in the security advisories (Your name will not be published if you choose to remain anonymous)."
User guideline,"What is a vulnerability? - In the process of computation graphs in PaddlePaddle, models can perform arbitrary computations , including reading and writing files, communicating with the network, etc. It may cause memory exhaustion, deadlock, etc., which will lead to unexpected behavior of PaddlePaddle. We consider these behavior to be security vulnerabilities only if they are out of the intention of the operation involved.



Some unexpected parameters and behaviors have been checked in PaddlePaddle by throwing exceptions in Python or return error states in C++. In these cases, denial of service is still possible, but the exit of the PaddlePaddle is clean. Since the error handling of PaddlePaddle is expected and correct, these cases are not security vulnerabilities.



If malicious input can trigger memory corruption or non-clean exit, such bug is considered a security problem.

User guideline,"Support Scope - This library was not designed with security in mind. If you are processing data that needs
to be protected we suggest you use a quality wrapper around OpenSSL.
[`pyca/cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/) is one example of such a wrapper.
The primary use-case of this library is as a portable library for interoperability testing
and as a teaching tool.

**This library does not protect against side-channel attacks.**

Do not allow attackers to measure how long it takes you to generate a key pair or sign a message.
Do not allow attackers to run code on the same physical machine when key pair generation or
signing is taking place (this includes virtual machines).
Do not allow attackers to measure how much power your computer uses while generating the key pair
or signing a message. Do not allow attackers to measure RF interference coming from your computer
while generating a key pair or signing a message. Note: just loading the private key will cause
key pair generation. Other operations or attack vectors may also be vulnerable to attacks. 
For a sophisticated attacker observing just one operation with a private key will be sufficient
to completely reconstruct the private key.

Fixes for side-channel vulerabilities will not be developed.

Please also note that any Pure-python cryptographic library will be vulnerable to the same
side-channel attacks. This is because Python does not provide side-channel secure primitives
(with the exception of [`hmac.compare_digest()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#hmac.compare_digest)),
making side-channel secure programming impossible.

This library depends upon a strong source of random numbers. Do not use it on a system
where `os.urandom()` does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers."

User guideline,"How we do security - As much as possible, TorchServe relies on automated tools to do security scanning. In particular, we support:

1. Dependency Analysis: Using Dependabot
2. Docker Scanning: Using Snyk
3. Code Analysis: Using CodeQL"
User guideline,"Important Security Guidelines - 1. TorchServe listens on the following ports
    1. HTTP - `8080`, `8081`, `8082`
    2. gRPC - `7070`, `7071`

    These ports are accessible to `localhost` by default.  The addresses can be configured by following the guides for
    [HTTP](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configure-torchserve-listening-address-and-port) and
    [gRPC](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configure-torchserve-grpc-listening-addresses-and-ports).
    TorchServe does not prevent users from configuring the address to be of any value, including the wildcard address `0.0.0.0`.
    Please be aware of the security risks of configuring the address to be `0.0.0.0`, this will give all addresses(including publicly accessible addresses, if any)
    on the host, access to the TorchServe endpoints listening on the ports shown above.
2. By [default](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile), TorchServe's Docker image is configured to expose the ports `8080`, `8081`, `8082`, `7070`, `7071` to the host. When starting the container,
   map the ports exposed by the container to `localhost` ports or a specific IP address, as shown in this [security guideline](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md#security-guideline).

3. Be sure to validate the authenticity of the `.mar` file being used with TorchServe.
    1. A `.mar` file being downloaded from the internet from an untrustworthy source may have malicious code, compromising the integrity of your application.
    2. TorchServe executes the arbitrary python code packaged in the `mar` file. Make sure that you've either audited that the code you're using is safe and/or is from a source that you trust.
    3. TorchServe supports custom [plugins](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/plugins) and [handlers](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/custom_service.md).
       These can be utilized to extend TorchServe functionality to perform runtime security scanning using tools such as:
        - Clamd: https://pypi.org/project/clamd/
        - VirusTotal: https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/
        - Fickling: https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling
    4. Running TorchServe inside a container environment and loading an untrusted `.mar` file does not guarantee isolation from a security perspective.
4. By default, TorchServe allows you to register models from all URLs. Make sure to set `allowed_urls` parameter in config.properties to restrict this. You can find more details in the [configuration guide](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#other-properties).
    - `use_env_allowed_urls=true` is required in config.properties to read `allowed_urls` from environment variable.
5. Enable SSL:

    TorchServe supports two ways to configure SSL:
    1. Using a keystore
    2. Using private-key/certificate files

    You can find more details in the [configuration guide](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#enable-ssl).
6. Prepare your model against bad inputs and prompt injections. Some recommendations:
    1. Pre-analysis: check how the model performs by default when exposed to prompt injection (e.g. using [fuzzing for prompt injection](https://github.com/FonduAI/awesome-prompt-injection?tab=readme-ov-file#tools)).
    2. Input Sanitation: Before feeding data to the model, sanitize inputs rigorously. This involves techniques such as:
        - Validation: Enforce strict rules on allowed characters and data types.
        - Filtering: Remove potentially malicious scripts or code fragments.
        - Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.
        - Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection)).
7. If you intend to run multiple models in parallel with shared memory, it is your responsibility to ensure the models do not interact or access each other's data. The primary areas of concern are tenant isolation, resource allocation, model sharing and hardware attacks.
8. TorchServe enforces token authorization by default: check [documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/token_authorization_api.md) for more information.
9. By default, TorchServe prevents you from registering and deleting models after startup. Check out Model API control [documentation](./docs/model_api_control.md) for more information."

User guideline,"Spark RPC (Communication protocol between Spark processes) - Security features like authentication are not enabled by default. When deploying a cluster that is open to the internet
or an untrusted network, it's important to secure access to the cluster to prevent unauthorized applications
from running on the cluster.

Spark supports multiple deployments types and each one supports different levels of security. Not
all deployment types will be secure in all environments and none are secure by default. Be
sure to evaluate your environment, what Spark supports, and take the appropriate measure to secure
your Spark deployment.

There are many different types of security concerns. Spark does not necessarily protect against
all things. Listed below are some of the things Spark supports. Also check the deployment
documentation for the type of deployment you are using for deployment specific settings. Anything
not documented, Spark does not support."
User guideline,Authentication
User guideline,"YARN - Spark currently supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Authentication can
be turned on by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter.

The exact mechanism used to generate and distribute the shared secret is deployment-specific. Unless
specified below, the secret must be defined by setting the `spark.authenticate.secret` config
option. The same secret is shared by all Spark applications and daemons in that case, which limits
the security of these deployments, especially on multi-tenant clusters.

The REST Submission Server supports HTTP `Authorization` header with
a cryptographically signed JSON Web Token via `JWSFilter`.
To enable authorization, Spark Master should have
`spark.master.rest.filters=org.apache.spark.ui.JWSFilter` and
`spark.org.apache.spark.ui.JWSFilter.param.secretKey=BASE64URL-ENCODED-KEY` configurations, and
client should provide HTTP `Authorization` header which contains JSON Web Token signed by
the shared secret key. Please note that this feature requires a Spark distribution built with
`jjwt` profile."
User guideline,"Kubernetes - For Spark on [YARN](running-on-yarn.html), Spark will automatically handle generating and
distributing the shared secret. Each application will use a unique shared secret. In
the case of YARN, this feature relies on YARN RPC encryption being enabled for the distribution of
secrets to be secure.

    the External Shuffle Service restarts.
  </td>
  <td>3.5.0</td>
</tr>
</table>"
User guideline,"Network Encryption - On Kubernetes, Spark will also automatically generate an authentication secret unique to each
application. The secret is propagated to executor pods using environment variables. This means
that any user that can list pods in the namespace where the Spark application is running can
also see their authentication secret. Access control rules should be properly set up by the
Kubernetes admin to ensure that Spark authentication is secure.

</tr>
<tr>

User guideline,"SSL Encryption (Preferred) - Spark supports two mutually exclusive forms of encryption for RPC connections:

The **preferred method** uses TLS (aka SSL) encryption via Netty's support for SSL. Enabling SSL
requires keys and certificates to be properly configured. SSL is standardized and considered more
secure.

The legacy method is an AES-based encryption mechanism relying on a shared secret. This requires
RPC authentication to also be enabled. This method uses a bespoke protocol and it is recommended
to use SSL instead.

One may prefer to use the SSL based encryption in scenarios where compliance mandates the usage
of specific protocols; or to leverage the security of a more standard encryption library. However,
the AES based encryption is simpler to configure and may be preferred if the only requirement
is that data be encrypted in transit.

If both options are enabled in the configuration, the SSL based RPC encryption takes precedence
and the AES based encryption will not be used (and a warning message will be emitted)."
User guideline,"AES-based Encryption (Legacy) - Spark supports SSL based encryption for RPC connections. Please refer to the SSL Configuration
section below to understand how to configure it. The SSL settings are mostly similar across the UI
and RPC, however there are a few additional settings which are specific to the RPC implementation.
The RPC implementation uses Netty under the hood (while the UI uses Jetty), which supports a
different set of options.

Unlike the other SSL settings for the UI, the RPC SSL is *not* automatically enabled if
`spark.ssl.enabled` is set. It must be explicitly enabled, to ensure a safe migration path for users
upgrading Spark versions."
User guideline,"Local Storage Encryption - Spark supports AES-based encryption for RPC connections. For encryption to be enabled, RPC
authentication must also be enabled and properly configured. AES encryption uses the
[Apache Commons Crypto](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-crypto/) library, and Spark's
configuration system allows access to that library's configuration for advanced users.

This legacy protocol has two mutually incompatible versions. Version 1 omits applying key derivation function
(KDF) to the key exchange protocol's output, while version 2 applies a KDF to ensure that the derived session
key is uniformly distributed. Version 1 is default for backward compatibility. It is **recommended to use version 2**
for better security properties. The version can be configured by setting `spark.network.crypto.authEngineVersion` to
1 or 2 respectively.

There is also support for SASL-based encryption, although it should be considered deprecated. It
is still required when talking to shuffle services from Spark versions older than 2.2.0.

The following table describes the different options available for configuring this feature.

User guideline,Authentication and Authorization
User guideline,"Spark History Server ACLs - Enabling authentication for the Web UIs is done using [jakarta servlet filters](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/filter).
You will need a filter that implements the authentication method you want to deploy. Spark does not
provide any built-in authentication filters.

Spark also supports access control to the UI when an authentication filter is present. Each
application can be configured with its own separate access control lists (ACLs). Spark
differentiates between ""view"" permissions (who is allowed to see the application's UI), and ""modify""
permissions (who can do things like kill jobs in a running application).

ACLs can be configured for either users or groups. Configuration entries accept comma-separated
lists as input, meaning multiple users or groups can be given the desired privileges. This can be
used if you run on a shared cluster and have a set of administrators or developers who need to
monitor applications they may not have started themselves. A wildcard (`*`) added to specific ACL
means that all users will have the respective privilege. By default, only the user submitting the
application is added to the ACLs.

Group membership is established by using a configurable group mapping provider. The mapper is
configured using the <code>spark.user.groups.mapping</code> config option, described in the table
below.

The following options control the authentication of Web UIs:

Spark also supports retrieving `${ns}.keyPassword`, `${ns}.keyStorePassword` and `${ns}.trustStorePassword` from
[Hadoop Credential Providers](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CredentialProviderAPI.html).
User could store password into credential file and make it accessible by different components, like:

```
hadoop credential create spark.ssl.keyPassword -value password \
    -provider jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/ssl.jceks
```

To configure the location of the credential provider, set the `hadoop.security.credential.provider.path`
config option in the Hadoop configuration used by Spark, like:

```
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
    <value>jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/ssl.jceks</value>

User guideline,"YARN mode - Key stores can be generated by `keytool` program. The reference documentation for this tool for
Java 17 is [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/keytool.html).
The most basic steps to configure the key stores and the trust store for a Spark Standalone
deployment mode is as follows:

* Generate a key pair for each node
* Export the public key of the key pair to a file on each node
* Import all exported public keys into a single trust store
* Distribute the trust store to the cluster nodes"
User guideline,"Standalone mode - To provide a local trust store or key store file to drivers running in cluster mode, they can be
distributed with the application using the `--files` command line argument (or the equivalent
`spark.files` configuration). The files will be placed on the driver's working directory, so the TLS
configuration should just reference the file name with no absolute path.

Distributing local key stores this way may require the files to be staged in HDFS (or other similar
distributed file system used by the cluster), so it's recommended that the underlying file system be
configured with security in mind (e.g. by enabling authentication and wire encryption)."
User guideline,"HTTP Security Headers - The user needs to provide key stores and configuration options for master and workers. They have to
be set by attaching appropriate Java system properties in `SPARK_MASTER_OPTS` and in
`SPARK_WORKER_OPTS` environment variables, or just in `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`.

The user may allow the executors to use the SSL settings inherited from the worker process. That
can be accomplished by setting `spark.ssl.useNodeLocalConf` to `true`. In that case, the settings
provided by the user on the client side are not used."

User guideline,"Standalone mode only - Generally speaking, a Spark cluster and its services are not deployed on the public internet.
They are generally private services, and should only be accessible within the network of the

User guideline,"Long-Running Applications - Spark supports submitting applications in environments that use Kerberos for authentication.
In most cases, Spark relies on the credentials of the current logged in user when authenticating
to Kerberos-aware services. Such credentials can be obtained by logging in to the configured KDC
with tools like `kinit`.

When talking to Hadoop-based services, Spark needs to obtain delegation tokens so that non-local
processes can authenticate. Spark ships with support for HDFS and other Hadoop file systems, Hive
and HBase.

When using a Hadoop filesystem (such HDFS or WebHDFS), Spark will acquire the relevant tokens
for the service hosting the user's home directory.

An HBase token will be obtained if HBase is in the application's classpath, and the HBase
configuration has Kerberos authentication turned (`hbase.security.authentication=kerberos`).

Similarly, a Hive token will be obtained if Hive is in the classpath, and the configuration includes
URIs for remote metastore services (`hive.metastore.uris` is not empty).

If an application needs to interact with other secure Hadoop filesystems, their URIs need to be
explicitly provided to Spark at launch time. This is done by listing them in the
`spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems` property, described in the configuration section below.

Spark also supports custom delegation token providers using the Java Services
mechanism (see `java.util.ServiceLoader`). Implementations of
`org.apache.spark.security.HadoopDelegationTokenProvider` can be made available to Spark
by listing their names in the corresponding file in the jar's `META-INF/services` directory.

Delegation token support is currently only supported in YARN and Kubernetes mode. Consult the
deployment-specific page for more information.

The following options provides finer-grained control for this feature:

<table class=""spark-config"">
<thead><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Since Version</th></tr></thead>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.security.credentials.${service}.enabled</code></td>
  <td><code>true</code></td>
  <td>
    Controls whether to obtain credentials for services when security is enabled.
    By default, credentials for all supported services are retrieved when those services are
    configured, but it's possible to disable that behavior if it somehow conflicts with the
    application being run.
  </td>
  <td>2.3.0</td>

<tr>
  <td><code>spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems</code></td>
  <td>(none)</td>

    A comma-separated list of secure Hadoop filesystems your Spark application is going to access. For
    example, <code>spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems=hdfs://nn1.com:8032,hdfs://nn2.com:8032,
    webhdfs://nn3.com:50070</code>. The Spark application must have access to the filesystems listed
    and Kerberos must be properly configured to be able to access them (either in the same realm
    or in a trusted realm). Spark acquires security tokens for each of the filesystems so that
    the Spark application can access those remote Hadoop filesystems.

</tr>
</table>

Users can exclude Kerberos delegation token renewal at resource scheduler. Currently it is only supported
on YARN. The configuration is covered in the [Running Spark on YARN](running-on-yarn.html#yarn-specific-kerberos-configuration) page."
User guideline,"Using a Keytab - Long-running applications may run into issues if their run time exceeds the maximum delegation
token lifetime configured in services it needs to access.

This feature is not available everywhere. In particular, it's only implemented
on YARN and Kubernetes (both client and cluster modes).

Spark supports automatically creating new tokens for these applications. There are two ways to
enable this functionality."
User guideline,"Using a ticket cache - By providing Spark with a principal and keytab (e.g. using `spark-submit` with `--principal`
and `--keytab` parameters), the application will maintain a valid Kerberos login that can be
used to retrieve delegation tokens indefinitely.

Note that when using a keytab in cluster mode, it will be copied over to the machine running the
Spark driver. In the case of YARN, this means using HDFS as a staging area for the keytab, so it's
strongly recommended that both YARN and HDFS be secured with encryption, at least."
User guideline,"Secure Interaction with Kubernetes - By setting `spark.kerberos.renewal.credentials` to `ccache` in Spark's configuration, the local
Kerberos ticket cache will be used for authentication. Spark will keep the ticket renewed during its
renewable life, but after it expires a new ticket needs to be acquired (e.g. by running `kinit`).

It's up to the user to maintain an updated ticket cache that Spark can use.

The location of the ticket cache can be customized by setting the `KRB5CCNAME` environment
variable."
User guideline,"Event Logging - When talking to Hadoop-based services behind Kerberos, it was noted that Spark needs to obtain delegation tokens
so that non-local processes can authenticate. These delegation tokens in Kubernetes are stored in Secrets that are
shared by the Driver and its Executors. As such, there are three ways of submitting a Kerberos job:

In all cases you must define the environment variable: `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` or
`spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName.`

It also important to note that the KDC needs to be visible from inside the containers.

If a user wishes to use a remote HADOOP_CONF directory, that contains the Hadoop configuration files, this could be
achieved by setting `spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName` to a pre-existing ConfigMap.

1. Submitting with a $kinit that stores a TGT in the Local Ticket Cache:
```bash
/usr/bin/kinit -kt <keytab_file> <username>/<krb5 realm>
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.HdfsTest \
    --master k8s://<KUBERNETES_MASTER_ENDPOINT> \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \
    --conf spark.app.name=spark-hdfs \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark:latest \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.path=/etc/krb5.conf \
    local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_<VERSION>.jar \
    <HDFS_FILE_LOCATION>
```
2. Submitting with a local Keytab and Principal
```bash
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.HdfsTest \
    --master k8s://<KUBERNETES_MASTER_ENDPOINT> \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \
    --conf spark.app.name=spark-hdfs \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark:latest \
    --conf spark.kerberos.keytab=<KEYTAB_FILE> \
    --conf spark.kerberos.principal=<PRINCIPAL> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.path=/etc/krb5.conf \
    local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_<VERSION>.jar \
    <HDFS_FILE_LOCATION>
```

3. Submitting with pre-populated secrets, that contain the Delegation Token, already existing within the namespace
```bash
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.HdfsTest \
    --master k8s://<KUBERNETES_MASTER_ENDPOINT> \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \
    --conf spark.app.name=spark-hdfs \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark:latest \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.tokenSecret.name=<SECRET_TOKEN_NAME> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.tokenSecret.itemKey=<SECRET_ITEM_KEY> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.path=/etc/krb5.conf \
    local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_<VERSION>.jar \
    <HDFS_FILE_LOCATION>
```

3b. Submitting like in (3) however specifying a pre-created krb5 ConfigMap and pre-created `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` ConfigMap
```bash
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.HdfsTest \
    --master k8s://<KUBERNETES_MASTER_ENDPOINT> \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \
    --conf spark.app.name=spark-hdfs \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark:latest \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.tokenSecret.name=<SECRET_TOKEN_NAME> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.tokenSecret.itemKey=<SECRET_ITEM_KEY> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName=<HCONF_CONFIG_MAP_NAME> \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.configMapName=<KRB_CONFIG_MAP_NAME> \
    local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_<VERSION>.jar \
    <HDFS_FILE_LOCATION>

User guideline,"Persisting driver logs in client mode - If your applications are using event logging, the directory where the event logs go
(`spark.eventLog.dir`) should be manually created with proper permissions. To secure the log files,
the directory permissions should be set to `drwxrwxrwxt`. The owner and group of the directory
should correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server.

This will allow all users to write to the directory but will prevent unprivileged users from
reading, removing or renaming a file unless they own it. The event log files will be created by
Spark with permissions such that only the user and group have read and write access."

- You are unsure how a publicly announced vulnerability in an upstream project affects WireMock,
  and you suspect users might be impacted.
- You think you discovered a new vulnerability in another project that WireMock depends on.
  If so, make sure to report the issue to that project too by following their guidelines

Note that security hardening enhancements are not considered vulnerabilities,
and the common Request for Enhancement issue report should be used."
Reporting mechanism,"How to report an issue? - Most of WireMock repositories use the _GitHub Security Advisory_ engine
under the _Security_ tab for issue reporting.
Use it to submit the vulnerability reports,
and only maintainers will be able to see and triage your reports.
They will contact you to negotiate the disclosure time and the next steps.

If you cannot use the GitHub reporting flow or if you didn't get a response within one week,
you can also email the private `conduct@wiremock.org` list with the security details and the details expected for the bug reports.
It is not the main intent of this channel, but the security issues will be routed too.

For upstream projects and WireMock components with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process,
please follow those processes."
Projects practise,"Public Disclosure Timing - A public disclosure date is negotiated by WireMock maintainers and the bug submitter.
We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available in WireMock and in downstream projects and distributions.
Note that it might take some time to coordinate releases and announcements 
even after the fix is available.
The WireMock maintainers will coordinate that.

The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few months.
We intend to release fixes no later than 3 months according to the current independent security research practices.
We urge reporters to not disclose issues in public channels and social media before that."

Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Vulnerability - We use Github's built-in [Private Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature to accept vulnerability reports.

1. Go to the Security tab on our Github repo: https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/security

2. Click the [""Report a Vulnerability""](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/security/advisories/new) button

3. Fill out the form to submit the details of the report and it will be securely sent to the maintainers

You can also contact the maintainers via our public [Zulip Chat Server zulip.archivebox.io](https://zulip.archivebox.io) or [Twitter DMs @ArchiveBoxApp](https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp)."

Scope of practise,"Supported Versions - For supported versions, see the [Zope development roadmap](https://www.zope.dev/developer/roadmap.html)."
Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Vulnerability - Please do **NOT** create a public bug report if you think this may be a security issue.
Instead, please contact the Plone and Zope Security Team via email: security@plone.org. See also https://plone.org/security/report

Only bug reports submitted directly to the security team email will be treated as responsible disclosure. Any offered for sale to third parties or submitted to public bug bounty programmes will be treated as irresponsible public disclosure. We will not confirm any submissions on third party platforms such as ""huntr"" or ""hackerone"" and do not give permission for those systems to accept reports on our behalf or to represent themselves as a conduit for vulnerability reports."
Generic policy,"Security Policy - All Pallets projects share the same security policy. See
https://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,
which this is copied from."
User guideline,"Before Reporting - There are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be
found at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please
review the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of
caution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to
report a regular issue instead."
Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Security Issue - If you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or
Pallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a
security issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the
project's repository, click ""Security"" at the top, then click ""Advisories"" at
the left, then click the green ""New draft security advisory"" button.
Alternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),
and we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting
normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address
the issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also
helpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.

A maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will
obtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with
you to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers
are volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any
specific timeline. Please be patient during this process.

The current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the
previous feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information
and severity, but is not guaranteed.

Reporting mechanism,"Security Policy - Please refer to the Snowflake [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team) for our security policies and for reporting any security vulnerabilities.

vulnerability and how to reproduce it. Someone will reply to acknowledge receipt of the that the

Reporting mechanism,"Report a security issue - [//]: # (ATTENTION: This is the .MD version of docs/security.rst. Any changes should also be made in the RST version.)

We take security very seriously.
Your input and feedback on our security
is always appreciated.

You can send urgent or sensitive reports via [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/new).

If you prefer, you can send via email to <security@twistedmatrix.com>.
You may use our PGP public key if you wish. We will create a GitHub
security advisory to coordinate a fix. Include your GitHub username so
that we add you as a collaborator on the advisory. See
[GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq)
for an example. We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Twisted is an all volunteer project and there may be some delay before
we can respond.

Feel free to follow up if you think an unreasonable amount of time has
elapsed without a response!

All releases, including security releases, are announced on the mailing
list. Consider subscribing to receive notification about the
availability of a security fix."
User guideline,"Security Procedure for Developers - The goal of the normal Twisted development procedure is to make all
steps transparent and record all information at all times in a public
location - either the issue tracker or a branch.

The goal of the security variation of the Twisted development procedure
is to keep track of progress resolving security issues while minimizing
the window of time where information useful to attackers is available
before a fix for the issue is available to Twisted users.

This process is intended as a helpful recommendation. Elements of it may
be followed more or less strictly depending on the severity of the issue
in question:

1.  Begin by filing a ticket which does not describe the issue and
    simply says 'security issue, description pending' and has the
    'security' keyword.
2.  Create a security advisory in GitHub using the [GitHub
    UI](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/new).
    This will trigger the creation of a private repository that can be
    use for developing a patch. This automatically created private
    repository is also used to review the PR in private.
3.  Make the required changes to fix the security issue in the new
    private repository.
4.  Create a new PR using the GitHub security advisory UI. This will
    generate a private PR. Request the review and get the approval for
    the PR. Don't merge the PR after approval. In the PR description
    define the desired merge commit message. The PR will be merged by
    the release manager at the same time with the first release
    candidate.
5.  Automated notifications for the private repository and private PR
    are limited. Try to communicate over IRC, gitter or other means to
    find a person to review the new PR. Coordinate with the release
    manager. More info about the release process can be found on the
    [release process](docs/development/release-process.rst) dedicated page.
6.  We are not aware of a way to securely transmit our code to our
    public continuous integration systems. Reviewers should manually run
    the automated tests on their local forks of the new private
    repository.

Aside from hiding the details of the issue while development is ongoing,
all of the normal policies apply. Security fixes require unit tests,
code review, etc."

User guideline,"Bad input - Any place we receive untrusted data, we need to be careful. In some
cases we are not careful enough. For example, in HTTP there are many
places where strings need to be converted to ints, so we use `int()` .
The problem is that this will accept negative or hexadecimal

Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Vulnerability - The aim of pwntools is exploiting software vulnerabilities, which is an unusual position, but it nevertheless can have its own security issues.
Especially that an attacker (=re-victim) is usually not prepared to be attacked back (by the re-attacker).

The first question to ask yourself is: is this an actual vulnerability?
- can it be triggered by a re-attacker (malicious honeypot pretending to be a vulnerable service)?
- does it impact the attacker (=re-victim)?
- is it serious?
  * *availability: medium* means *at least* exhausting RAM or disk space of the attacker (=re-victim)
  * *confidentiality: medium* means *at least* reading the filesystem of the attacker (=re-victim)
  * *integrity: medium* means *at least* performing uncontrolled actions or data corruption on behalf of the attacker (=re-victim)
  * if crucial for some sophisticated exploit chain, it is always serious
  * `safe_eval` bypasses **are** serious.
  * an example of what was **kind of** serious: [#1732](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/pull/1732)
- can it be fixed without compromising on Pwntools' usability?

If at least one of the answers is no, then this is NOT a vulnerability, so just file a bug report or feature request, without the weird confidential disclosure dance.

Just e-mail the maintainers.  Arusekk is the one that is currently the most excited to fix vulnerabilities.

User guideline,"Security Considerations - The wake of CVE-2022-24840 revealed the importance to document security considerations.
The following attack vectors have been considered during development. Should there be
a possible vector or consideration missing, please contact the maintainers, as described
below.

We use [pre-signed POST URLs](s3-pre-signed-url) to upload files to AWS S3.
[Django's internal signer](django-signing) is used to sign the upload path and validate
it before fetching files from S3.

Please note, that Django's signer uses the `SECRET_KEY`, rotating the key will void all
signatures. Should you rotate the secret key, between a form GET and POST request, the
form will fail. Similarly, Django will expire all sessions if you rotate the key.

[s3-pre-signed-url]: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html
[django-signing]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/signing/"
User guideline,"Upload of malicious files - AWS S3 supports MIME type detection and content-type enforcement.
You can limit the upload of malicious files via the MIME type [accept][accept].
However, this is not a security measure, and you should always validate files before
processing them.

[accept]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept"
User guideline,"Request file injection - Though files can always be included in a request, CVE-2022-24840 revealed that we need
to consider people injecting any files that reside on your S3 bucket. However, we do
presign the upload location and validate it before fetching files from S3."
User guideline,"Path traversal & timing attacks - We fetch files from your S3 bucket. This behavior could be used to brute force valid
file names. We mitigate this by signing the allowed upload path and validating it.
The upload path is unique for each file input and request. Therefore, an attacker can
not escape and access any files but the one uploaded by the attacker."

If we determine that your report may be a security issue with the project, we may contact you for further information.
We volunteers ask that you delay public disclosure of your report for at least ninety (90) days from the date you report it to us.
This will allow sufficient time for us to process your report and coordinate disclosure with you.

Once verified and fixed, the following steps will be taken.

-   We will use GitHub's Security Advisory tool to report the issue.
-   GitHub will review our Security Advisory report for compliance with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) rules.
    If it is compliant, they will submit it to the MITRE Corporation to generate a [CVE](https://www.cve.org/).
    This in turn submits the CVE to the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).
    GitHub notifies us of their decision.
-   Assuming it is compliant, we then publish our Security Advisory on GitHub, which triggers the next steps.
-   GitHub will publish the CVE to the CVE List.
-   GitHub will broadcast our Security Advisory via the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories).
-   GitHub will send [security alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) to all repositories that use our package (and have opted into security alerts).

-   We will make a bug-fix release.
-   We will send an announcement through our usual channels, including those listed on the Pylons Project website's [Contact](https://pylonsproject.org/about-contact.html) page.

User guideline,"Security Policy - tlslite-ng received little-to-none 3rd party security review.

tlslite-ng **CANNOT** verify certificates – users of the library must use
external means to check if certificate of the peer is the expected one.

Because python execution environment uses hash tables to store variables (that
includes functions, objects and classes) it's very hard to create
implementations that are timing attack resistant. Additionally, all integers
use arbitrary precision arithmentic, so binary operations are data dependant
(see Hubert Kario
[blog post](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/)
on this topic). This means that CBC MAC-then-encrypt de-padding leaks timing
information and all pure python cipher implementations will leak timing
information. None of the included cipher implementations are written in a way
that even tries to hide the data dependance.

In other words, pure-python (tlslite-ng internal) implementations of all
ciphers, as well as all CBC mode ciphers working in MAC-then-encrypt mode are
**NOT** secure. Don't use them. In addition to that, use AEAD ciphersuites
(AES-GCM) or encrypt-then-MAC mode for CBC ciphers.

(Note: PyCrypto aes-gcm cipher is also not secure as it uses Python to
calculate GCM tag, see issue

Reporting mechanism,"Reporting a Suspected Vulnerability - The PyYAML project encourages responsible disclosure of suspected security
vulnerabilities. However, we do not offer bug bounties, paid disclosure, or
paid fixes for discovered vulnerabilities. To report a suspected security
vulnerability, please e-mail details to <security@pyyaml.org> without creating
public issues, pull requests, or discussion. Non-security correspondence to
this address will be ignored."
Reporting mechanism,"Security Policy - If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

Please submit the report through the
[Launchpad bug-tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+filebug) (you may need to
create an account and log in). Make sure to mark the ""🔒 This bug is a security
vulnerability"" checkbox before submitting the report. This ensures the bug can only be
seen by the security group.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

This project is maintained by a few maintainers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such,
we ask that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure."

Generic policy,"Security Policy - To report security issues with projects under the Pylons Project, send email to: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com.
If we determine that your report may be a security issue with the project, we may contact you for further information.
We volunteers ask that you delay public disclosure of your report for at least ninety (90) days from the date you report it to us.
This will allow sufficient time for us to process your report and coordinate disclosure with you.

Once verified and fixed, the following steps will be taken.

-   We will use GitHub's Security Advisory tool to report the issue.
-   GitHub will review our Security Advisory report for compliance with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) rules.
    If it is compliant, they will submit it to the MITRE Corporation to generate a [CVE](https://www.cve.org/).
    This in turn submits the CVE to the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).
    GitHub notifies us of their decision.
-   Assuming it is compliant, we then publish our Security Advisory on GitHub, which triggers the next steps.
-   GitHub will publish the CVE to the CVE List.
-   GitHub will broadcast our Security Advisory via the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories).
-   GitHub will send [security alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) to all repositories that use our package (and have opted into security alerts).
    This includes Dependabot alerts.
-   We will make a bug-fix release.
-   We will send an announcement through our usual channels, including those listed on the Pylons Project website's [Contact](https://pylonsproject.org/about-contact.html) page.
-   We will provide credit to the reporter or researcher in the vulnerability notice."

click ""Security"" at the top, then click ""Advisories"" at the left, then click the
green ""New draft security advisory"" button. Alternatively, you may email
[security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com), and we will
convert that to a GitHub security advisory.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting
normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address
the issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also
helpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.

A maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will
obtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with
you to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers
are volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any
specific timeline. Please be patient during this process.

The current feature release will receive security fixes. Fixes to older versions
may be considered based on usage information and severity, but are not
guaranteed. After fixing an issue, we will make a new release.

Projects practise,"Public Discussions - When a new vulnerability is reported and verified, a new security advisory is created on
GitHub and the issue is assigned a CVE identifier. Progress on the mitigation is tracked
on a private fork, where the incident-response team and developers communicate to fix
the issue.

When the fix is ready, a release plan is prepared and all communication channels are
used to notify the community of the presence of a new issue and the expected release
plan. This allows the community time to prepare for a security upgrade. (Notice that
security fixes are not backported at the moment.)

When the advisory is published, GitHub automatically notifies all associated projects of
the published advisory. Projects that use IdPy projects as dependencies should
automatically get Pull Requests by dependabot. Additionally, all communication channels
are used again, to notify the community of the release of a new version of the affected
software that contains the relevant fixes that mitigate the reported issue."

However, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in PyTorch, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report security issues using https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/new

Please refer to the following page for our responsible disclosure policy, reward guidelines, and those things that should not be reported:

https://www.facebook.com/whitehat"
User guideline,"Using Pytorch Securely - **Pytorch models are programs**, so treat its security seriously -- running untrusted models is equivalent to running untrusted code. In general we recommend that model weights and the python code for the model are distributed independently. That said, be careful about where you get the python code from and who wrote it (preferentially check for a provenance or checksums, do not run any pip installed package)."
User guideline,"Untrusted models - Be careful when running untrusted models. This classification includes models created by unknown developers or utilizing data obtained from unknown sources[^data-poisoning-sources].

**Prefer to execute untrusted models within a secure, isolated environment such as a sandbox** (e.g., containers, virtual machines). This helps protect your system from potentially malicious code. You can find further details and instructions in [this page](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing).

**Be mindful of risky model formats**. Give preference to share and load weights with the appropriate format for your use case. [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/en/index) gives the most safety but is the most restricted in what it supports. [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html#torch.load) with `weights_only=True` is also secure to our knowledge even though it offers significantly larger surface of attack. Loading un-trusted checkpoint with `weights_only=False` MUST never be done.



Important Note: The trustworthiness of a model is not binary. You must always determine the proper level of caution depending on the specific model and how it matches your use case and risk tolerance.

[^data-poisoning-sources]: To understand risks of utilization of data from unknown sources, read the following Cornell papers on Data poisoning:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04748
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566"
User guideline,"Untrusted inputs during training and prediction - If you plan to open your model to untrusted inputs, be aware that inputs can also be used as vectors by malicious agents. To minimize risks, make sure to give your model only the permissions strictly required, and keep your libraries updated with the latest security patches.

If applicable, prepare your model against bad inputs and prompt injections. Some recommendations:
- Pre-analysis: check how the model performs by default when exposed to prompt injection (e.g. using fuzzing for prompt injection).
- Input Sanitation: Before feeding data to the model, sanitize inputs rigorously. This involves techniques such as:
    - Validation: Enforce strict rules on allowed characters and data types.
    - Filtering: Remove potentially malicious scripts or code fragments.
    - Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.
    - Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection))."
User guideline,"Data privacy - **Take special security measures if your model if you train models with sensitive data**. Prioritize [sandboxing](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing) your models and:
- Do not feed sensitive data to untrusted model (even if runs in a sandboxed environment)
- If you consider publishing a model that was partially trained with sensitive data, be aware that data can potentially be recovered from the trained weights (especially if model overfits)."
User guideline,"Using distributed features - PyTorch can be used for distributed computing, and as such there is a `torch.distributed` package. PyTorch Distributed features are intended for internal communication only. They are not built for use in untrusted environments or networks.

For performance reasons, none of the PyTorch Distributed primitives (including c10d, RPC, and TCPStore) include any authorization protocol and will send messages unencrypted. They accept connections from anywhere, and execute the workload sent without performing any checks. Therefore, if you run a PyTorch Distributed program on your network, anybody with access to the network can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running PyTorch."
User guideline,"CI/CD security principles - _Audience_: Contributors and reviewers, especially if modifying the workflow files/build system.

PyTorch CI/CD security philosophy is based on finding a balance between open and transparent CI pipelines while keeping the environment efficient and safe.

PyTorch testing requirements are complex, and a large part of the code base can only be tested on specialized powerful hardware, such as GPU, making it a lucrative target for resource misuse. To prevent this, we require workflow run approval for PRs from non-member contributors. To keep the volume of those approvals relatively low, we easily extend write permissions to the repository to regular contributors.

More widespread write access to the repo presents challenges when it comes to reviewing changes, merging code into trunk, and creating releases. [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) are used to restrict the ability to merge to the trunk/release branches only to the repository administrators and merge bot. The merge bot is responsible for mechanistically merging the change and validating reviews against the path-based rules defined in [merge_rules.yml](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.github/merge_rules.yaml). Once a PR has been reviewed by person(s) mentioned in these rules, leaving a `@pytorchbot merge` comment on the PR will initiate the merge process. To protect merge bot credentials from leaking, merge actions must be executed only on ephemeral runners (see definition below) using a specialized deployment environment.

To speed up the CI system, build steps of the workflow rely on the distributed caching mechanism backed by [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache), making them susceptible to cache corruption compromises. For that reason binary artifacts generated during CI should not be executed in an environment that contains an access to any sensitive/non-public information and should not be published for use by general audience. One should not have any expectation about the lifetime of those artifacts, although in practice they likely remain accessible for about two weeks after the PR has been closed.

To speed up CI system setup, PyTorch relies heavily on Docker to pre-build and pre-install the dependencies. To prevent a potentially malicious PR from altering ones that were published in the past, ECR has been configured to use immutable tags.

To improve runner availability and more efficient resource utilization, some of the CI runners are non-ephemeral, i.e., workflow steps from completely unrelated PRs could be scheduled sequentially on the same runner, making them susceptible to reverse shell attacks. For that reason, PyTorch does not rely on the repository secrets mechanism, as these can easily be compromised in such attacks."
User guideline,"Release pipelines security - To ensure safe binary releases, PyTorch release pipelines are built on the following principles:
 - All binary builds/upload jobs must be run on ephemeral runners, i.e., on a machine that is allocated from the cloud to do the build and released back to the cloud after the build is finished. This protects those builds from interference from external actors, who potentially can get reverse shell access to a non-ephemeral runner and wait there for a binary build.
 - All binary builds are cold-start builds, i.e., distributed caching/incremental builds are not permitted. This renders builds much slower than incremental CI builds but isolates them from potential compromises of the intermediate artifacts caching systems.
 - All upload jobs are executed in a [deployment environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) that are restricted to protected branches
 - Security credentials needed to upload binaries to PyPI/conda or stable indexes `download.pytorch.org/whl` are never uploaded to repo secrets storage/environment. This requires an extra manual step to publish the release but ensures that access to those would not be compromised by deliberate/accidental leaks of secrets stored in the cloud.
 - No binary artifacts should be published to GitHub releases pages, as these are overwritable by anyone with write permission to the repo."

Generic policy,"Security Policy - If you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets-Eco project,
**do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a security issue, use
GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the project's repository,
click ""Security"" at the top, then click ""Advisories"" at the left, then click the
green ""New draft security advisory"" button. Alternatively, you may email
[security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com), and we will
convert that to a GitHub security advisory.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting
normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address
the issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also
helpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.

A maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will
obtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with
you to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers
are volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any
specific timeline. Please be patient during this process.

The current feature release will receive security fixes. Fixes to older versions
may be considered based on usage information and severity, but are not
guaranteed. After fixing an issue, we will make a new release.
